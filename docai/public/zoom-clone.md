## Environment Setup Guidelines

### Project Setup Guidelines

Hereâ€™s a detailed setup instruction guide based on the provided `package.json` with specified scripts (dev, build, start, lint).

### Project Setup Instructions

#### 1. Installing Dependencies

Before running your project, you'll need to install its dependencies. Follow these steps:

- **Step 1: Install Node.js and npm**
  Before you start, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download and install them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/). npm comes bundled with Node.js.

- **Step 2: Navigate to Your Project Directory**
  Use the terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the root directory of your project:

  ```bash
  cd /path/to/your/project
  ```

- **Step 3: Install Dependencies**
  Run the following command to install all the dependencies specified in your `package.json`:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

#### 2. Running Development Scripts

After installing the dependencies, you can run the development scripts defined in your `package.json`. Hereâ€™s how:

- **Step 1: Start Development Server**
  To start the development server, use:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

  This command often sets up a local development environment and serves your application, usually with hot reloading enabled.

- **Step 2: Lint Your Code**
  To ensure your code adheres to defined standards, you can lint it by running:

  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

  This command typically runs a linter such as ESLint on your source files.

- **Step 3: Build Your Application**
  If you need to compile or bundle your application for production, use:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

  This script generates the necessary files for a production-ready deployment, such as optimized static assets.

- **Step 4: Start Application**
  To start your application in production mode, run:
  ```bash
