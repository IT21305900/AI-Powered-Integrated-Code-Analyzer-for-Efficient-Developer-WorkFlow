## Introduction

In software Industry developers frequently adapting to new or legacy codebases in different project environments. Before commence the development the process of understanding a project codebase often involves resource intensive activities such as Knowledge Transfer(KT) sessions, adapting to new libraries/frameworks and extensive code study. 

Our research aims to automate and simplify the project transition and onboarding for developers by automating code study and providing better insights aligned with the project codebase


## Research Questions

1.  What challenges do developers face when onboarding to a new software development project?
2.  What methods and tools do developers use to prepare for a project, and how can automation tools assist in the process?
3.  How do AI technologies in modern software engineering affect traditional developer workflows?



## Objective

To develop and validate an automated solution for understanding and analyzing software project code repositories, while leveraging advance AI technologies to enhance developer learning experience and accelerate software dev team productivity


## Sub Module

1. Documentation - Generate comprehensive code documentation from project codebase
2. Chat Assistant - Assist the developer as a digitalized KT assistant in the developer learning
3. Visualization - Provide visual aid on project flows for developers
4. Code Feedback - Provide industrial guidance and assistant to developers by providing feedbacks
